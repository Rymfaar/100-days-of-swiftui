- Functions let us re-use code without repeating ourselves.
- Functions can accept parameters – just tell Swift the type of each parameter.
- Functions can return values, and again you just specify what type will be sent back. Use tuples if you want to return several things.
- You can use different names for parameters externally and internally, or omit the external name entirely.
- Parameters can have default values, which helps you write less code when specific values are common.
- Variadic functions accept zero or more of a specific parameter, and Swift converts the input to an array.
- Functions can throw errors, but you must call them using `try` and handle errors using `catch`.
- You can use `inout` to change variables inside a function, but it’s usually better to return a new value.
