- Loops let us repeat code until a condition is false.
- The most common loop is `for`, which assigns each item inside the loop to a temporary constant.
- If you don’t need the temporary constant that `for` loops give you, use an underscore instead so Swift can skip that work.
- There are `while` loops, which you provide with an explicit condition to check.
- Although they are similar to `while` loops, `repeat` loops always run the body of their loop at least once.
- You can exit a single loop using `break`, but if you have nested loops you need to use `break` followed by whatever label you placed before your outer loop.
- You can skip items in a loop using `continue`.
- Infinite loops don’t end until you ask them to, and are made using `while true`. Make sure you have a condition somewhere to end your infinite loops!
