- Arrays, sets, tuples, and dictionaries let you store a group of items under a single value. They each do this in different ways, so which you use depends on the behavior you want.
- Arrays store items in the order you add them, and you access them using numerical positions.
- Sets store items without any order, so you canâ€™t access them using numerical positions.
- Tuples are fixed in size, and you can attach names to each of their items. You can read items using numerical positions or using your names.
- Dictionaries store items according to a key, and you can read items using those keys.
- Enums are a way of grouping related values so you can use them without spelling mistakes.
- You can attach raw values to enums so they can be created from integers or strings, or you can add associated values to store additional information about each case.
