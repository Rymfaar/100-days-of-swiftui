# 100-days-of-swiftui

Challenging myself to follow the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course.

## Introduction

This course is composed of a 15-day introduction to Swift followed by SwiftUI.

Each day is around 1 hour long.

## Requirement

I'm using a MacBook under macOS BigSur and Xcode v12.3.

> It should work on Catalina too.
