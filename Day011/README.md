- Protocols describe what methods and properties a conforming type must have, but donâ€™t provide the implementations of those methods.
- You can build protocols on top of other protocols, similar to classes.
- Extensions let you add methods and computed properties to specific types such as `Int`.
- Protocol extensions let you add methods and computed properties to protocols.
- Protocol-oriented programming is the practice of designing your app architecture as a series of protocols, then using protocol extensions to provide default method implementations.
