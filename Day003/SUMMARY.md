- Swift has operators for doing arithmetic and for comparison; they mostly work like you already know.
- There are compound variants of arithmetic operators that modify their variables in place: `+=`, `-=`, and so on.
- You can use `if`, `else`, and `else if` to run code based on the result of a condition.
- Swift has a ternary operator that combines a check with true and false code blocks. Although you might see it in other code, I wouldn’t recommend using it yourself.
- If you have multiple conditions using the same value, it’s often clearer to use `switch` instead.
- You can make ranges using `..<` and `...` depending on whether the last number should be excluded or included.
