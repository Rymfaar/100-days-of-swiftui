- You can assign closures to variables, then call them later on.
- Closures can accept parameters and return values, like regular functions.
- You can pass closures into functions as parameters, and those closures can have parameters of their own and a return value.
- If the last parameter to your function is a closure, you can use trailing closure syntax.
- Swift automatically provides shorthand parameter names like `$0` and `$1`, but not everyone uses them.
- If you use external values inside your closures, they will be captured so the closure can refer to them later.
